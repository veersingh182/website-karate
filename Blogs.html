                            There are traces of various martial arts in Indian history that describe the use of spears, swords, shields, and bows. Martial arts were not an optional extracurricular activity for our forefathers, but rather a required part of their daily routine. After years of practice and improvement, Martial Arts eventually became a part of the culture.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            People in India used to be very fit and healthy due to the high physical work interactions they had in their daily lives, but technological advancement has had a significant impact. People nowadays are more focused on mental and static work, which not only causes stress and mental imbalance but also diverts people from many physical activities. This is why young people should take care of their bodies, get active, and get their bodies back into shape.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Martial arts are a fusion of yoga, aerobics, sports, and a variety of other physical exercises in a specifically designed format for attack and defence. Martial arts training offers numerous physical benefits as well as the ability to defend oneself. Karate is a type of martial art that focuses on making people physically strong as well as mentally calm when it comes to self-defence.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Self-defence allows one to be self-sufficient and is a valuable skill that everyone should learn. Martial arts' intentions are not immorality or emotionlessness, but to promote determination, perseverance, consistency, and discipline, as well as to strengthen individuals to fight for good and help the weak. Martial arts, more than sport, fighting, or self-defence, is about knowing the essence and expression of life, as Bruce Lee once said, "To be a martial artist means to be an artist of life."
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Martial arts have the ability to instil self-confidence and respect in people. Citizens of a developing country, such as India, should be healthy, active, and, above all, happy. Thus, martial arts are a great option because it contributes to an individual's physical and mental development while also preserving the nation's intangible cultural heritage.

                        Karate has played a categorical role in shaping my persona. Not only did it help me to increase my concentration level, but it also recharged those laxative neurons in my brain, which resulted in a remarkable improvement in my studies. Besides, I acquired leadership skills as well as teamwork and communication skills. Having spent all this time in a martial arts academy, I learned the importance of team spirit...<a href="javascript:void(0);" class="continueReading">read more &rarr;</a>

                            Let me share with you an anecdote about my beginner days as a karate enthusiast. I was new to karate and was unable to do rolling. Our instructor, Gaurav Sir, motivated and instilled fire within every cadet. He kept motivating us until all of us had mastered the knack of rolling. Each cadet at the Karate Academy was very supportive and helped me throughout my journey, which enhanced my performance. Every class used to be a critical addition to our karate as well as our interpersonal skills.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            This place has taught me that working together and thinking of the whole team as one ensures the development of every cadet. Karate keeps one physically fit, active and healthy. In my situation, I would say that karate ensorcelled me at a very young age of 10. It was the time when, despite my earnest wish to learn karate, the journey came to a halt when my instructor met with an accident. But the angels had something left for me in the store. My tryst with karate resumed when I came to know about the Martial Arts Karate Academy at NIT Hamirpur in the Campus. I see it as a great opportunity.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            I joined the academy without giving it a second thought. Today I am an orange belt in Karate, and it’s all because of the guidance and support of our coordinators, Gaurav Sir, and all my benevolent fellow cadets at the Karate academy. I have secured the second rank in the Electrical Engineering branch, and big credit goes to karate, as it helped me build focus.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            On a concluding note, I would like to say that the milieu we have at Martial Arts Karate Academy is very motivating and enthusiastic. All the cadets are amicable and helpful. We are never differentiated on the basis of seniority. One who learns first helps others in their learning as well as training, no matter if he/she is junior or senior. Everyone works as a team, which is one of the keynote features of the Martial Arts Karate Academy, NIT Hamirpur.
                        </span>

                            We've only been through a short journey in this pandemic, I was very excited when I joined the academy. After our online class routine began, Abhijeet Sir made certain that we were well acquainted with the fundamentals and did his best to ensure that these classes produced the best possible results.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            But I was completely frustrated, sitting at home by myself and messing up my life. I began to experience some health issues and then began to lose some of the remaining positive energy. I decided to leave the classes and all the karate groups one day.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Namrata ma'am and Ishwar sir then inquired as to why I was leaving the groups and becoming unmotivated. I told them my reasons, and they understood my situation and convinced me that we are strong enough to deal with all of these issues because we are far better off than the majority. Eventually, Abhijeet sir convened a meeting and asked me about the difficulties I was experiencing. He is extremely polite and patient with everyone. Then he tried to persuade me of the positive aspects of it and said something I desperately needed to hear at the time. One thing he keeps reminding us of is how much fun we'll have in offline classes. This single statement elicited ecstasy in me. Then I returned to the academy. And now I'm trying to attend as many events as possible.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            As a result, I'm eager to get a taste of offline classes as soon as possible.

                        Today, I am proud to be a member of the Martial Arts Karate Academy at NIT Hamirpur. I used to be a scrawny kid who was terrified of any kind of difficult task, but karate has changed my outlook on life.

                            Some people believe that martial arts are all about hurting others or getting into fights, but this is not the case! Karate is primarily a self-defence technique. It promotes the growth of strength, endurance, agility, and flexibility. It also reduces stress by encouraging you to focus on your training and forget about the stresses of work. As a result, it improves your prowess and character development. When you're in a DOJO hall, you forget about your worries and frustrations; instead, you strive to achieve your highest level and improve your self-discipline.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            I used to watch WWE and UFC as a kid. I used to fantasize about becoming a world-class fighter there. But, in essence, I was a shy, scrawny, faint-hearted kid who was terrified almost all the time. In school, I didn't have the opportunity to learn karate. But then, in college, I was able to pursue all of my ambitions, and I significantly improved my stamina and confidence. Learning Karate didn't only boost my stamina and fighting skills, but also uplifted my self-confidence and focus to fulfil my dreams. It helped me to channelize my aggression and increase my concentration power. Karate really relaxed me.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            I just want to say, "Don't give up." Continue to do what you truly enjoy, rekindle your zeal, and do what makes you happy. Stay enthusiastic and follow up on your dreams; put in all your dedication; and enjoy the results. Grab every opportunity and build your future.
                        </span>

                        <span>
                            Practice every day as " Practice makes a man perfect". Strive hard to make your aspirations a reality.

                    Martial Arts Karate Academy NIT Hamirpur, is driven by the zeal of its Founder Gaurav Pratap Sharma. The journey of the establishment of the Academy was full of hurdles and adventures. But those obstacles were nothing in comparison to the determination and dedication of the founder. There is a saying that <em><strong>“If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door”</strong></em>, he indeed opened the door of opportunities for the students of NIT Hamirpur to excel in martial Arts and self-defense techniques along with their engineering studies.

                    The journey of the foundation of <em><strong>Martial Arts Karate Academy NIT Hamirpur </strong></em> began around 2016 when Gaurav Sharma started training many students, unofficially though but effectively. Months of efforts resulted in the administration taking note of the efforts and achievements of the students. 3 May 2018, was the red-letter day to pave the way for the establishment of the Academy as the astounding foundation of the Academy took place on this propitious day by the unforgettable efforts of founders of the academy along with the support of administration. On 3 May 2018, an official order was issued by the authorities of NIT Hamirpur stating “Mr. Gaurav Sharma, is designated as the Student Coordinator (Karate), who will initiate the process of setting up of Martial Arts Karate Academy as well as conduct of Self Defense Classes at NIT Hamirpur in consultation with Associate Professor (Physical Education) of the Institute”.

                    On the day of 14 February 2019, director of the institute inaugurated the <em>dojo hall</em> at Central Block of NIT Hamirpur. The dojo hall was allocated to the Academy for the conduction of classes of the Karate Cadets. All the efforts, the founders and supporters gave for establishing the Martial Arts Karate Academy NIT Hamirpur proved worth it.
